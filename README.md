# LiReddit

This is an (almost) one-to-one implementation of the LiReddit full-stack web app utilizing the [PERN stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-pern-stack/), as presented by [Ben Awad](https://github.com/benawad) in his youtube tutorial [Fullstack React GraphQL TypeScript Tutorial](https://youtu.be/I6ypD7qv3Z8?si=ZJfcL6o5YsyUjx2_ "https://youtu.be/I6ypD7qv3Z8?si=ZJfcL6o5YsyUjx2_"). 

  

I have documented the entire process from start to finish in my [Upnote](https://getupnote.com) app and exported my notes to the **/docs** folder for anyone that would find them useful. I exported the notes both as markdown files for easy import to other apps (such as UpNote) as well as .pdf files. I have also provided a .pdf file that merges all of the notes in one single file **(200+ pages!)**.

  

The tech stack for this project is as follow:

  

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [URQL](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql)
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)
- [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/)

  

In [01.1 package.json - Server](docs/markdown/01.1%20package.json%20-%20Server.md) and [02 package.json - Web](docs/markdown/02.%20package.json%20-%C2%A0Web.md) I have provided the dependencies installed. <ins>**Make sure to install these versions**</ins> if you plan to code along, in order to avoid any incompatibilities due to package version differences. 

  

Overall this is a great project (alas a bit dated) to learn full-stack development basics with the PERN stack.  Kudos to [Ben Awad](https://github.com/benawad)!
