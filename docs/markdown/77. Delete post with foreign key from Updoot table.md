# 77\. Delete post with foreign key from Updoot table

#graphql #resolver #authentication#mutation #backend#typeorm #error #foreignkey #cascade

* * *

- Currently when we try to delete a post that has an upvote or downvote we get a foreign key constraint error:

       `update or delete on table \"post\" violates foreign key constraint \"FK_fd6b...bb5\" on table \"updoot\"`  

- Here we will see two ways to resolve this issue:

## Manually delete the corresponding entry in the updoots table

**/resolver/post.ts**

```typescript
@UseMiddleware(isAuth)
@Mutation(() => Boolean)
async deletePost(
  @Arg("id", () => Int) id: number,
  @Ctx() { req }: MyContext
): Promise<boolean> {
  const post = await Post.findOne(id);

  if (!post) {
    return false;
  }

  if (post.creatorId !== req.session.userId) {
    throw new Error("Not authorized");
  }

  await Updoot.delete({ postId: id });
  await Post.delete({ id });
  return true;
}
```

## Cascade delete the corresponding entry from the updoot table

- We define in the Updoot entity, that when a post is deleted it should cascade to the updoot entry and delete that entry as well

**/entities/Updoot.ts**

```typescript
@ManyToOne(() => Post, (post) => post.updoots, { onDelete: "CASCADE" })
post: Post;
```
