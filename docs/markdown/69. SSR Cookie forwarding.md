## Find the cookie in the next.js server

- In the createUrqlClient function, we can pass a ct⁠x context object. So if we update the code as such:

  

/utils/createUrqlClient

```typescript
// this code runs both on the browser and the server
export const createUrqlClient = (ssrExchange: any, ctx: any) => {
  if (isServer()) { // we don't have the ctx object on the browser
     console.log(ctx)
   }
   return {
      // .... all the code remains the same .....
   }
}
```

  

We see that there’s A LOT of stuff in the ctx object:

- And if we scroll through this we see that there’s a req object and a res object in the ctx
- The cookie can be seen in req.headers (as well as req.rawHeaders and req,cookies.cookie)
- **Note that** ⁠in my implementation req.headers was not displayed when I `console.log`’ged ctx. But when I `console.log`’ged ctx.req.headers it displayed:

- And more specifically, `console.log("cookie: ", ctx.req.headers.cookie)` gives: 

  

   cookie: 'qid=s%3AxKYTRiDKpZDlvndcPxXJR4c67Axzofro.jbJWjTqWfX%2BecvUWG99I8fSVOHrwnfC0wwU%2FADan1DY'  

  

- So all we want to do is to send this cookie from next.js to graphql

## Find headers field in fetchOptions()

- First ctrl+click `“urql”` import

- Then ctrl+click `“@urql/core”` import 

  

    ![](Files/image%2023.png)  

  

- Then ctrl+click `⁠"./client"` import 

  

 ![](Files/image%2024.png)  

  

- we see that in client.d.ts we have fetchOptions in ClientOptions

  

  ![](Files/image%2025.png)

  

- ctrl+click on RequestInit to see that the definition in lib.dom.d.ts has the headers field in it 

  

  ![](Files/image%2026.png)  

  

- And if we ctrl+click HeadersInit type we also see it’s definition:

  

  ![](Files/image%2027.png)  

  

- **Note that** if it didn’t have the headers field in it, we could’ve added it ourselves

* * *

## Send cookie to backend via fetchOptions()

- Now we just send the cookie to the backend in the headers field of fetchOptions()
- **Note that** we send it as an object

  

**/utils/createUrqlClient.ts**

```typescript
// this code runs both on the browser and the server
export const createUrqlClient = (ssrExchange: any, ctx: any) => {
  let cookie = "";
  if (isServer()) {
    // we don't have the ctx object on the browser
    cookie = ctx.req.headers.cookie;
  }

  return {
    url: "http://localhost:4000/graphql",
    fetchOptions: {
      credentials: "include" as const,
      headers: cookie ? { cookie } : undefined,
    },
```

  

* * *

## Conclusion

- And now everything is working. The next.js server sends the cookie in the header and the graphql api receives the cookie retrieves the session.userId from it and even when we refresh the page the the userVote value is sent to frontend

## (Optional) Enable server-side meQuery() 

- We were preventing the execution of meQuery()  on the server through these lines. So a request was made from the client for it, 

**/components/NavBar.tsx**

```typescript
const [{ data, fetching }] = useMeQuery({
  pause: isServer(), // this will prevent the query from running on the server (there's no cookie on the server to look for)
});
```

  

- Request after a refresh:

- We can actually enable it now since the server also receives the cookie. This way everything is done on the server side and we are not making any requests to the server from client side when we refresh the page

**/components/NavBar.tsx**

```typescript
const [{ data, fetching }] = useMeQuery();
```

  

- No more requests after a refresh:

- In the tutorial Ben leaves it client-side with `⁠pause: isServer()`
